1. What is Statistics?
2. Population vs Sample
3. Find the Measures of Central Tendency:-  Marks of 5 students: [ 60, 70, 80, 75, 65 ] also find variance and standard deviation. 
4. What is skewed ?
5. List vs Tuple 
6. define a function in python for sum of two number ? 
7. what is different is and == ? 
8. A fair six-sided die is rolled twice. What is the probability of getting 2 on the first roll and not getting 4 on the second roll?
9. FInd the Z and T value for Population mean = 50, σ = 10 
Sample mean = 54, n = 40, α = 0.05 , Z = ?

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(30),
    salary INT,
    city VARCHAR(30)
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Amit', 'IT', 50000, 'Delhi'),
(2, 'Neha', 'HR', 45000, 'Mumbai'),
(3, 'Ravi', 'IT', 60000, 'Delhi'),
(4, 'Priya', 'Finance', 70000, 'Chennai'),
(5, 'Karan', 'HR', 48000, 'Mumbai'),
(6, 'Sneha', 'IT', 75000, 'Delhi');

10. FInd the all employees details where salary greater than 50000 ?
11. Find the top 2 highest paid employees
12. Department-wise average salary
13. data = {
    "customer_id": range(1, 101),
    "age": np.random.randint(18, 60, 100),
    "gender": np.random.choice(["Male", "Female"], 100),
    "monthly_income": np.random.randint(20000, 80000, 100),
    "spending_score": np.random.randint(1, 100, 100),
    "region": np.random.choice(["North", "South", "East", "West"], 100)
}
14. Find the missing value and removed missing value .
15. A sample of students scores an average of 85 on a test. The population mean is 80 with a standard deviation of 10. The sample size is 25. Is the sample mean significantly different at
𝛼 = 0.05, then find the Z-score or T-Score ?
